This project simulates a simplified version of a Blackjack game:
The player will be dealt one card at the start of the game (where a game is one round of play). 
The player, based on the value of their cards, can either ask for another card (a hit) or choose to hold (stand). 
The dealer will then begin their turn and try to beat the player’s hand. 
The player is competing against the dealer, who has their own hand. 
Whomever is closer to 21 at the end of the game (as long as they don’t exceed 21) wins the game.
1. Player’s turn: Player tries to reach or come close to 21 without going over (as 21 is the highest hand).
2. 2. Dealer’s turn: Dealer tries to beat exceed the player’s hand without going over 21.
3. Determine the winner at the end of the game and increment the win count.
4. Repeat!
